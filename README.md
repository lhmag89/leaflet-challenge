# leaflet-challenge
This is a project to build a map to visualize global earthquake data. The visualization is based on earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 and higher over the last month. The dataset was choosen from: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

## Technologies
HTML, CSS, Javascript, leaflet, d3

## Installation Guide
A web browser is needed to run the html file and associated files. A new data set can be visualized by taking the url from the usgs site containing the desired geojson data. The url can be saved as "queryurl" in the logic.js to make sure the map uses that data.

## Usage
Once the dataset is selected and html file opened, the user can interact with the map to view location, time, magnitude and depth data of individual earthquakes.
